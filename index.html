"But how is that possible? <span style="color:#bcb33e;">No one can place objects in my house except myself!"</span> And the villagers left, without a word.

			            Their diversity will also make them fewer, giving you more time to build a base.
			            For those who think that the bases become useless, don't forget the importance of the <span style="color:#bcb33e;">low walls</span> that will allow you to attack the ghouls <span style="color:#bcb33e;">without being touched, and without leaving your base</span>, as well as the <span style="color:#bcb33e;">low doors</span>. It is also important to build several doors in opposite places. If a ghoul could destroy one of your walls, flee to the other side.
			            If a ghoul is chasing you, consider putting a building in a narrow path to block the road.
			            If a ghoul chases you around a fire, <span style="color:#bcb33e;">you can turn around it</span>, it will do the same. This will give you time to make a <span style="color:#bcb33e;">spear</span>, or <span style="color:#bcb33e;">bow</span>.
